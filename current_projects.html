<h2> Current Projects </h2>
<ul>
<li> <h3>Climate change induced water stress â€“ participatory modeling to identify risks and opportunities in Austrian regions (WaterStressAT), IIASA (2021)</h3>
<br><em> Collaborators: Taher Kahil, Peter Burek, Luca Guillamot, Susanne Hanger-Koppe, Veronica Karabaczek-IIASA; Martina Offenzeller</em>

<br><i>Project Description: </i>
<p>WaterStressAT aims to assess water availability and demand in Austrian regions considering alternative socio-economic and climate futures, to understand the risk of water stress and associated management opportunities. It will achieve these aims in a truly transdisciplinary way, establishing a stakeholder engagement process spanning the entire project duration with respect to participatory modeling efforts, co-producing bottom-up water stress scenarios, as well as risk management options.</p>

<li> <h3>Water Security Assessment in Europe and Central Asia, IIASA (2021) </h3>
<br><em> Collaborators: IIASA, HYDROPHIL, InterSus </em>
<br><i>Project Description </i>
<p></p> This project aims to assess and benchmark current and future challenges around water security in the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) region; and, to develop an operational Methodological Framework to conduct country and regional Water Security Assessments and Benchmarking as well as to provide country specific recommendations using an Action Planning Tool.

<li> <h3>Dynamics of groundwater depletion (2021) </h3>
<br><em> Collaborators: Prof. Dennis McLaughlin, MIT</em>
<br><i>Project Description </i>
<p>This research focuses on the numerical implementation of dynamic optimization techniques for single and multiple-agent control problems. Building frameworks to permit the use of more realistic description of the physical system that provide a better qualitative insight for decision making.</p>
